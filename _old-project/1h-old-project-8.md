This was a project in collaboration with [Ashwin Sridharan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashwin-sridharan-0128043/), then at Sprint Labs, which explored issues that arise in CDMA networks when devices (mobiles) are afforded 
some level of independence in making transmission decisions, instead of being under the tight control of a base station. Giving mobile devices some flexibility in 
deciding when to transmit and at what rate is increasingly desirable because of the diversity of applications they are now capable of running and that exhibit a broad 
range of communication requirements. However, allowing devices to make individually controlled transmission decisions may affect global system performance, and one of 
the goals of this project is to explore this trade-off in a number of different settings.
