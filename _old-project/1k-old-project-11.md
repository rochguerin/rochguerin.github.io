title: "Framework for Manageability in Future Routing Systems"

This was a joint project with [Prof. Zhi-Li Zhang at the University of Minnesota](http://www.cs.umn.edu/~zhzhang)
and [Prof. Lixin Gao at the University of Massachusetts](http:www-unix.ecs.umass.edu/~lgao/) funded by NSF under the [FIND initiative](http://www.nets-find.net/). 
The project addressed fundamental questions on building manageability into routing systems for future Internet architectures.
Its goals were two-fold: i) develop a framework for specifying, understanding, and evaluating what features should/could be
"designed-in" into routing systems in support of manageability; and ii) evaluate design choices and trade-offs thereof
in terms of performance and manageability.
