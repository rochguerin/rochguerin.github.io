title: "On the Economic Viability of Network Architectures. "
excerpt: "Supported by NSF grant CNS-0721610"

This was a joint project with [Prof. Kartik Hosanagar](https://www.hosanagar.com/) from the Wharton Business School and Profs. [Andrew Odlyzko](http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/) 
and [Zhi-Li Zhang](https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~zhang089/) from the University of Minnesota.  
The project had three main thrust areas aimed at assessing the economic viability of new network architectures:


1. Investigate and quantify the potential benefits of key proposed architectural features such as virtualization, integration, and diversity;
2. Explore when and why the existence of a formidable incumbent (today’s Internet) can affect the emergence of new technologies;
3. Develop models that account for how the openness and flexibility of a network architecture can foster the adoption of new technology, and its ultimate success.
