This work looked at when and where it is useful to aggregate reservations in order to minimize the amount of state and processing that needs to be performed in backbone routers. 
The focus was on developing an understanding of the storage and message cost of different reservation aggregation rules in the context of Internet-like topologies. 
The work involved both the development of efficient aggregation algorithms, and their evaluation, primarily by means of simulations, in realistic settings.
