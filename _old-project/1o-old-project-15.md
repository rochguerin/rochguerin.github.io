title: "Provisioning, Enforcing, and Pricing Temporal Service Differentiation in Virtualized Networked Environments"

The project focused on problems and technologies aimed at improving support for service differentiation and efficient
use of resources in the cloud. It had a number of targets, including:  i) improving the network stack in
virtualized systems such as Xen (Xen is an open-source hypervisor that is widely used, including until recently by Amazon); and
(ii) developing a scalable, real-time messaging system in supports of micros-services and serverless computing.  The project's scope
spanned both system-level efforts and more analytically focused investigations, in particular in the use of pricing in support of service differentiation.
