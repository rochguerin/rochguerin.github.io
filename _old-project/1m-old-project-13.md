This was a collaborative project with Profs. [Kartik Hosanagar](https://www.hosanagar.com/) (Penn, Wharton Business School), [Santosh Venkatesh](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~venkates/) 
(Penn, ESE department), and [Yong Tan](http://faculty.washington.edu/ytan/) (U. of Washington, Business School). 
The project sought to explore opinion formation and (product) adoption decisions in (social) networks.

The project had two main foci. The first was an empirical investigation of opinion formation in social networks, while the second dealt with the development 
of analytical models to study opinion formation in networks.
The empirical study sought to construct a predictive statistical framework to investigate the mechanisms of opinion formation and evolution in online communities where social 
interactions take place. The analytical models of opinion formation explored how individuals could be influenced by their network peers, in particular when those influences
could be biased based on an individual’s party affiliation. This was motivated by an interest in how external structures such as parties or clubs play a role in shaping the evolution of 
(networked) opinions.
