title: "Towards Large-Scale Flat Networks"
excerpt: "Supported by a grant from Siemens"

This was a project in collaboration with Siemens. Flat networks like Ethernet have many advantages in terms of simplicity and flexibility, e.g., plug-&-play and little 
or no configuration requirements. However, they suffer from a number of potential scalability limitations, which have limited the scope of their deployments and promoted 
the use of (hierarchical) routed solutions to build large networks, the Internet being a case in point. This work is not aimed at replacing the Internet with one big flat 
network, but it explores various issues aimed at improving the scalability of flat networks. In particular, it targets two important factors that affect scalability: 
(i) reliance on broadcast for address discovery; and (ii) loop prevention during path changes.
