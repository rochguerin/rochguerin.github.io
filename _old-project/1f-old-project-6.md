This work was aimed at developing a better understanding of the relations that exist between QoS provided as some aggregate level, e.g., a service class as in the 
Differentiated Services model, and the actual QoS that individual users experience. Of particular interest are models that allow explicit evaluation of individual 
QoS measures, and their use in identifying characteristics of user traffic that can result in significant differences between individual and aggregate QoS measures. 
This led to the development of models that allow the evaluation of the loss probability experienced by individual connections and when and why it differs from the 
aggregate loss probability. The environment that is assumed consists of a single FIFO queue where all the individual users belonging to the same service class are multiplexed. 
A separate but related perspective is that of security, namely, understanding the extent to which a single (or a few) user can affect the performance of many other users. 
In that context, we investigated the extent to which more sophisticated attack schemes can defeat existing mechanisms, and used that understanding towards developing better defenses.
