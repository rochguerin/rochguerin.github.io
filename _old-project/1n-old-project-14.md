This was collaborative project with [Prof. Constantine Dovrolis](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/Constantinos.Dovrolis/) at Georgia Tech. The project's main goal was to shed some light on factors that contribute to the success and 
evolvability of network protocols.  The project initially focused on the development and analysis of several models that seek to on one hand capture key aspects/features of 
protocol design, and on the other hand allow the systematic investigation of how differences in those features affect a protocolâ€™s success and in particular its adoption and 
ability to spawn a growing usage. A subsequent step in the investigation sought to translate the insight derived from those findings into either protocol instances that would 
inherit those properties, or into possible suggestions for modifications to existing protocols to improve their ability to evolve.
