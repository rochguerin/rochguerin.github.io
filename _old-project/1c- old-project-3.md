This work was based on both analysis (mostly simulations in this case), and experimentation on a testbed that consisted of routers with various Quality-of-Service (QoS) capabilities. 
In addition, a connection to the QBone (a QoS enabled portion of the Internet2 network) was used to complement the local testbed measurements with a wide area experiments. 
Of particular interest was the impact that network induced perturbations can have on conformance checks performed at boundaries between provider domains.
