I grew up in a suburb of [Paris](https://www.paris.fr/), France, called [Saint Cloud](https://www.saintcloud.fr/) and attended the [Cours Hattemer](https://www.hattemer.fr/) in Paris
before going to [Franklin (Ã‰cole Saint Louis de Gonzague)](http://www.franklinparis.fr/), also in Paris.  While in high school, I took a gap year and attended
[Aloysius Kolleg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloisiuskolleg) in [Bonn, Bad Godesberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Godesberg) in Germany.  

I did my undergraduate studies at [ENST, Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) (now called TELECOM Paris), and actually spent my last year in [Toulouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse) in the South-West of France
in the Satellite Communications Systems department (don't ask me why, but it was fun). I did my undergraduate thesis on "Jamming Resistant Multiple Access Methods for Satellite Systems." (sorry no link, this was written at a time where paper was the only game in town...)

After finishing my undergraduate studies, I attended [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu/), where I received both my MS (1984) and Ph.D. (1986) from the [Electrical Engineering department](https://ee.caltech.edu/).
My Ph.D. was supervised by [Prof. Edward Posner](https://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-114/114dedication.pdf) and my thesis was titled ["Queueing and Traffic in Cellular Radio"](https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1022/).
As a point of maybe vain pride, the [two journal papers](#thesis-papers) that came out of my thesis have been continuously cited each year since published (according
to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=54w2_AcAAAAJ) and at least until 2021). 

After graduating from Caltech, I joined the [IBM T.J. Watson Research Center](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/watson/), where I worked on many aspects related to quality of service
in broadband networks for over 12 years. When I left IBM in 1998 I was the manager of the Network Control and Services department.
I then started my academic career in the [Electrical and Systems Engineering](http://www.ese.upenn.edu/index.php) at the [University of Pennsylvania](http://www.upenn.edu/) as the Alfred Fitler Moore Professor of Telecommunications Networks.
In July 2013, I joined the department of [Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/) at [Washington University in Saint Louis](http://www.wustl.edu/) as the Harold B. and Adelaide G. Welge Professor as well as its new department chair.

In 2001, I co-founded Ipsum Networks (that eventually morphed into Iptivia) with [Raju Rajan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajurajan/), 
a former colleague from my days at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, and spent the next two years at Ipsum on part-time leave of absence from Penn and acting as its CEO. 
Ipsum pioneered the development of Layer 3 Management, which offers scalable and real-time visibility into the behavior (and problems) of IP networks, and allows rapid 
root-cause analysis and resolution of the often complex issues that commonly plague IP networks. I returned full-time to Penn in the Fall of 2004.
