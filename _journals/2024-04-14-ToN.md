title: "On the Benefits of Traffic `Reprofiling’ - The Multiple Hops Case -- Part I"
collection: journals
permalink: /journals/2024-04-14-ToN
excerpt: 'The paper investigates the potential benefits of proactively changing user-specified traffic profiles, potentially incurring an added (ingress) reprofiling delay, to help a network offer hard delay bounds with less bandwidth. The paper demonstrates that, while in the single hop case reprofiling is of no benefit when using an optimal EDF scheduler, this is not so in the multiple hops setting. This is because, while reprofiling imposes an added delay, it makes flows smoother, and when those benefits accrue over multiple hops, they can yield a more efficient solution. The paper illustrates the existence of this trade-off and develops an approach for devising near optimal reprofiling solutions.'
