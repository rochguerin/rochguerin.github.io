title: "On the Benefits of Traffic `Reprofiling’ The Single Hop Case"
collection: journals
permalink: /journals/2024-01-16-ToN
excerpt: 'The paper investigates the potential benefits of proactively changing user-specified traffic profiles, potentially incurring a reprofiling delay, to help a scheduler provide hard delay bounds to flows with less bandwidth. While reprofiling is of no benefit with an optimal EDF scheduler, the paper demonstrates that reprofiling can allow simple static priority and FIFO schedulers to significantly improve their performance, in some cases closely matching that of an EDF scheduler.'
