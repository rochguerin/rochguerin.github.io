The paper titled "Progressive Neural Compression for Adaptive Image Offloading under Timing Constraints" co-authored with 
Ruiqi Wang, Hanyang Liu, Jiaming Qiu, Moran Xu, and Chenyang Lu has just been accepted for presentation at [RTSS 2023](http://2023.rtss.org/).

The paper considers an image classification system where captured images are uploaded over a variable bandwidth channel and classification decisions need to be made by a certain deadline. The paper proposes a multi-objective rateless autoencoder that optimizes for multiple compression rates via stochastic taildrop to create a compression solution that produces features ordered according to their importance for inference performance, with feature transmissions proceeding in the order of their importance.  The benefits of the approach over sate-of-the-art solutions are demonstrated experimentally in an IoT testbed.
