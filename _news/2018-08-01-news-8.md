I attended the [Microsoft Research Faculty Summit](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/event/faculty-summit-2018/) in Redmond, WA. There were many interesting presentations. 
I was particularly interested by the [panel on "Intelligent Edge"](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/intelligent-edge/) that both reviewed Microsoft focus in that area and presented a number of perspectives on the topic. 
Also of interest was the announcement of the upcoming release of the [Open Network Emulator](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/microsoft/microsoft-open-source-its-secret-weapon-against-cloud-network-outages), 
and of the reintroduction of [Microsoft faculty Fellowships](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/faculty-fellowship/). 
During the Summit I also had a brief ["Researcher in the Hall"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzUv5rMxOfA&_lrsc=5aa77474-def5-476c-907d-6cb017161879) discussion describing some of the work we are doing at WashU.
