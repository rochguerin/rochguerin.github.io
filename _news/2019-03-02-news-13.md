I attended [Google's 2019 Networking Research Summit](https://sites.google.com/view/networkingresearchsummit2019/home) in Sunnyvale, CA. 
I truly enjoyed it, both in terms of the technical presentations and the opportunities for hallway discussions with old (well, not that old) and new colleagues alike.
