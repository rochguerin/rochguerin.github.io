The call for submissions to the NSF Workshop on Sustainable Computing for Sustainability co-organized with [Amy McGovern](https://mcgovern-fagg.org/amy/) and [Klara Nahrstedt](https://monet.cs.illinois.edu/people/klara/) is out.

The workshop will be held on April 16-17, 2024, at the [NSF headquarter in Alexandria, Virginia](https://new.nsf.gov/about/visit), and will follow a hybrid format to accommodate limited in-person attendance and open remote participation. 
The workshop is aimed at developing computing solutions that can help tackle climate change challenges, and conversely at ensuring that computing is itself designed and used while accounting for sustainability. 
Extended abstracts are due by February 15, 2024, with notification of acceptance by February 29, 2024.
