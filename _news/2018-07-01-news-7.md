I attended the [2018 CRA Conference at Snowbird](https://cra.org/events/2018-cra-conference-snowbird/). 
The conference is held every two years and brings together most of the leadership of the North American computing research community. 
This year's edition included a number of interesting panels including on teaching faculty, diversity in recruiting, recruiting initiatives and best practices, ranking, etc.
