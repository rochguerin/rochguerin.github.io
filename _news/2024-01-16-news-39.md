The paper titled “On the Benefits of Traffic `Reprofiling' The Single Hop Case” co-authored with Jiayi Song, Jiaming Qiu, and Henry Sariowan was just accepted for publication is in the [IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking](https://dl.acm.org/journal/ton).

The paper investigates the potential benefits of proactively changing user-specified traffic profiles, potentially incurring a reprofiling delay, to help a scheduler provide hard delay bounds 
to flows with less bandwidth.  While reprofiling is of no benefit with an optimal EDF scheduler, the paper demonstrates that reprofiling can allow simple static priority and FIFO schedulers to significantly improve their performance, 
in some cases closely matching that of an EDF scheduler.

An extended version that includes all proofs and some additional results is available on arxiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02222)
