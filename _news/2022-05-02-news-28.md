I participated in a panel titled *The Emerging Role of AI/ML in Next-Generation Networks* at the [1st International Workshop on AI/ML for Edge/Fog Networks (A4E 2022)](https://infocom.info/workshops/track/A4E) held jointly with [INFOCOM 2022](https://infocom2022.ieee-infocom.org/). 
As its title indicates, the panel aimed to discuss the role of AI/ML in edge networks, and I sought to illustrate their contributions as sources of both solutions and problems, i.e., they are a powerful that can be used to tackle networking problems but at the same time they are also users of network resources with networks affecting both their designs and deployments.
