I gave a keynote titled *AI/ML models and networks, a complex relationship* at the [6th Asia-Pacific Workshop on Networking (APNet 2022)](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/events/apnet2022/) held as a virtual event.  
As its title indicates, the keynote reflected on my experience with how AI/ML systems and networks interact, with AI/ML systems as both a source of new problems and new solutions for networks.
