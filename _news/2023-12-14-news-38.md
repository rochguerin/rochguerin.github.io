The paper titled “Progressive Neural Compression for Adaptive Image Offloading under Timing Constraints” co-authored with Ruiqi Wang, Hanyang Liu, Jiaming Qiu, Moran Xu, and my colleague [Chenyang Lu](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~lu/)
just received both the Best Student Paper Award and the Outstanding Paper Award at the IEEE [RTSS 2023](http://2023.rtss.org/) conference.

The paper leverages stochastic taildrop to train a rateless encoder that prioritizes transmissions of features of greater importance for inference tasks, e.g., classification.  This ensures robust performance even in the presence of severe bandwidth fluctuations.
