I am excited that our EAGER proposal titled "Speeding-up large-scale simulations of atmospheric composition" 
with [Kunal Agrawal](http://www.cse.wustl.edu/~kunal/), [Randall Martin](https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/) in EECE, 
and [Seb Eastham](https://lae.mit.edu/team/sebastian-eastham/) from MIT has just been approved for funding.

The project targets improving how fast the [GEOS-Chem 3D atmospheric simulation software](http://geos-chem.org/) 
runs by devising intelligent scheduling solutions adapted to the massively parallel compute infrastructure 
now available from the cloud.   The challenges lies in the combination of variable workloads across individual
tasks and an inherent trade-off between computation and communication efficiency when co-locating tasks on the
same processor.
