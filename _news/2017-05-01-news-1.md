The paper titled ["Pricing and Bidding Strategies for Cloud Computing Spot Instances"](http://openscholarship.wustl.edu/cse_research/1168) co-authored with Jiayi Song 
was presented at the [Smart Data Pricing Workshop](http://infocom2017.ieee-infocom.org/workshop/sdp-smart-data-pricing). 

The paper explores the role of spot pricing in cloud computing, and in particular under what conditions the availability of a (variable) spot pricing service can 
increase the cloud providers' revenue when compared to an offering that only includes a fixed price on-demand service.
