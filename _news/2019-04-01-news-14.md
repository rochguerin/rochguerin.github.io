My former student, [Soumya Sen](http://www.soumyasen.com/), is now a recently promoted and tenured Associate Professor in the [Department of Information Systems & Decision Sciences](http://www.csom.umn.edu/information-decision-sciences) 
at the Carlson School of Management of the University of Minnesota, and furthermore was named a [2019 McKnight Presidential Fellow at the University of Minnesota](http://www.scholarswalk.umn.edu/awards/mcknight/mcknight_fellows.html). 

Quoting from their website, "The McKnight Presidential Fellows Program is a three-year award given to the most promising individuals who have been granted both tenure and promotion to associate professor in an academic year. It recognizes recipients who are recommended by their college dean and chosen at the discretion of the executive vice president and provost based on excellence in research and scholarship, leadership, potential to build top-tier programs, and ability to advance University of Minnesota priorities." Congratulations to Soumya and well-deserved.
