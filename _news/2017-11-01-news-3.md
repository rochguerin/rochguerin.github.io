The paper ["Opinion formation in Ising networks"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468696417301003) co-authored with M.H. Afrasiabi and S. Venkatesh was published 
in the [Online Social Networks and Media Journal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/24686964) (Vol. 5, March 2018, pp. 1-22). 

The paper offers a possible explanation, arguably using a stylized model, for the emergence of highly polarized partisan's outcomes when party affiliation has a strong influence in 
how we weigh others opinions.
