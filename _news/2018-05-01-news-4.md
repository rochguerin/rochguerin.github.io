I attended the [NSF Workshop on Cloud Economics](https://umass-sustainablecomputinglab.github.io/nsfw/program.html) held at Stanford University on May 16-17, 2018. 
It was an exciting forum on this important topic and a report documenting the outcome of the workshop should be coming out later this year. 

Thanks to [David Irwin](http://www.ecs.umass.edu/~irwin/) (UMass) and [Bhuvan Urgaonkar](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~buu1/) (PennState) for organizing the workshop.
