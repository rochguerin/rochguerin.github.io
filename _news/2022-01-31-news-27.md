I gave at talk at the [UMass Amherst ECE seminar](https://ece.umass.edu/seminars) titled [Minimizing inter-datacenter network bandwidth under latency constraints](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14DIauJZnNC8SwmnVdE8UdfOH5UMIGBc3/view?usp=sharing).
The talk was based on work done as part of the [PhD thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YzWQw2OeWznWf8VjFLGFDOrU3bWUGHvN/view?usp=sharing) of [Jiayi Song](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiayi-song-1163a0137/), one of my Ph.D. students who just graduated, 
and that was carried out in collaboration with [Henry Sariowan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sariowan/) at Google.  The work was supported by NSF grants CNS-1514254 and CNS 2006530 with preliminary work made possible by a Google Faculty Research Award.
