The paper titled ["Adaptive Edge Offloading for Image Classification Under Rate Limit"](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2022.3197533) 
co-authored with Jiaming Qiu, Ruiqi Wang, Ayan Chakrabarti, and Chenyang Lu has been 
accepted for presentation at the [EMSOFT 2022 Conference](https://esweek.org/emsoft/) 
that will be held as a hybrid event in Shanghai, China, in October 2022.   

The paper investigates an edge computing scenario where weak and strong image classifiers located in local devices and an edge server, 
respectively, collaborate to make the most accurate image classification decisions possible, under the constraint that the number
of images that can be offloaded to the strong classifier in the edge server is rate limited using a token bucket 
mechanism.  The paper relies on a reinforcement learning approach to realize a simple policy that maximizes
classification accuracy under general image arrival patterns and arbitrary sequences of classification decisions.  You can check out the ["teaser" video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BtNg3--MwHFJstqhC--0vDYRjs8UVaFU/view?usp=sharing) for the talk ahead of the presentation at EMSOFT.
