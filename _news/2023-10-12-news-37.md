Our proposal to NSF for organizing a workshop on *Sustainable Computing for Sustainability* has been funded - [Klara Nahrsted](https://monet.cs.illinois.edu/people/klara/) at UIUC and [Amy McGovern](https://www.ou.edu/coe/cs/people/mcgovern) at U. Oklahoma are the co-PIs.
We will soon be putting out a call for inputs towards informing the themes on which the workshop will focus.  Watch out for its announcement, and please help disseminate it when it comes out.
