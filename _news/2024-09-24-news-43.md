The paper titled [“Optimizing Edge Offloading Decisions for Object Detection”]() co-authored with my student Jiaming Qiu, as well as Ruiqi Wang, Brooks Hu, and Chenyang Lu was just accepted for presentation ad the [ACM/IEEE Symposium on Edge Computing](SEC 2024](https://acm-ieee-sec.org/2024/).

The paper addresses the problem of object detection in an edge computing setting, where a (weak) detector is available on-board the cameras capturing objects to facilitate distributed decisions, but is supplemented by a shared (stronger) edge detector accessible across a network and available when local decisions are uncertain.
Resource constraints, e.g., network or edge detector capacity, however, limit the number of images that can be offloaded to the edge. Our goal is to identify which images to offload to maximize overall detection accuracy.  
The paper main contributions are in introducing a metric and a method for estimating it so as to be able to efficiently make such decisions online.
The approach is computationally frugal enough to run on embedded devices, and empirical findings indicate that it outperforms existing alternatives in improving detection accuracy even when the fraction of offloaded images is small.
