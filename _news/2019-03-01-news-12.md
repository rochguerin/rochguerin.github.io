I received a [Google Faculty Research Award](https://ai.google/research/outreach/faculty-research-awards/) for work on "Minimum Capacity Inter-Data Center Networks with Service Guarantees." 
I am looking forward to working on the problem in collaboration with our Google sponsor, [Henry Sariowan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sariowan/).
