The report on the [NSF Workshop on Sustainable Computing for Sustainability (NSF WSCS 2024)](https://nsf-gov-resources.nsf.gov/files/CISE_WSCS_RP_508_v1mp.pdf) is now available on [the NSF CISE AC website](https://new.nsf.gov/cise/advisory-committee).

The report was appoved for publication on the [CISE AC website](https://new.nsf.gov/cise/advisory-committee) and documents the findings and recommendations that came out of the NSF Workshop on Sustainable Computing for Sustainability.  
The workshop brought together 100 in-person participants and from 50 to 100 online attendees who explored how to make computing itself more sustainable and how to leverage computing to develop solutions to major sustainability challenges. The recommendations put forth in the report are the results of the collective insight and perspectives of all the participants. 
We hope that these recommendations will help trigger follow-on work and produce impactful outcomes over the years to come.
