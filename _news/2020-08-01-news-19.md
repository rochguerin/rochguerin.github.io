The [Technical Program](https://icnp20.cs.ucr.edu/program.html) of the [ICNP 2020 conference](https://icnp20.cs.ucr.edu/) was just finalized. 
We ended accepting 30 papers out of 185 submissions with papers going through a thorough review process and a comprehensive shepherding phase to ensure the highest quality publications. 
[Peter Steenkiste](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~prs/) and I are grateful to all members of the [Technical Program Committee](https://icnp20.cs.ucr.edu/tpc.html) who worked tirelessly to select 
an outstanding technical program. We are looking to seeing you all (mostly virtually) at ICNP in October.
