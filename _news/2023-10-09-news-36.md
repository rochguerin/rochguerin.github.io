We are hiring! After a very successful recruiting season last year, we are again recruiting and considering faculty applications 
at all levels and across all areas of computer science and engineering, though we anticipate an emphasis on autonomous systems (cyber-physical systems, 
preferably with incorporation of artificial intelligence/machine learning); computational social science; computational environmental
science; computer vision/imaging; and human-AI collaboration and interaction. If you know of anyone interested, please encourage them to apply
using our [Interfolio job posting](https://apply.interfolio.com/134119)
