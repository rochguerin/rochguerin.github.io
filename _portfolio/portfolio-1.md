This project was originally initiated through a gift from Google and is currently supported by NSF grant CNS-2006530.
Its focus is on exploring options for meeting the performance requirement of different traffic types on a shared
network, while minimizing the amount of bandwidth that the network requires to achieve this goal.  Performance metric
of interest are in the form of delay bound, and it is assumed that all traffic entering the netwoor is rate controlled,
e.g., through a token bucket.  One of the project's goal is to explore the trade-off associated with using simple
schedulers in terms of the added bandwidth they require.  Another goal is to investigate the extent to which ingress
reshaping of traffic flows can be of benefit in reducing bandwidth requirements.
