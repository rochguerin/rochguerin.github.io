title: "Progressive Neural Compression for Adaptive Image Offloading Under Timing Constraints"
collection: conferences
permalink: /conferences/2023-12-14-EMSOFT
excerpt: 'The paper leverages stochastic taildrop to train a rateless encoder that prioritizes transmissions of features of greater importance for inference tasks, e.g., classification. This ensures robust performance even in the presence of severe bandwidth fluctuations.'
