permalink: /conferences/2022-10-01-EMSOFT
excerpt: 'The paper investigates an edge computing scenario where weak and strong image classifiers located in local devices and an edge server, respectively, collaborate to make the most accurate image classification decisions possible, under the constraint that the number of images that can be offloaded to the strong classifier in the edge server is rate limited using a token bucket mechanism.  The paper relies on a reinforcement learning approach to realize a simple policy that maximizes classification accuracy under general image arrival patterns and arbitrary sequences of classification decisions.  The code for the system described in the paper is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn) and an extended version of the EMSOFT paper is accessible on arXiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00485)'

The paper investigates an edge computing scenario where weak and strong image classifiers located in local devices and an edge server, 
respectively, collaborate to make the most accurate image classification decisions possible, under the constraint that the number
of images that can be offloaded to the strong classifier in the edge server is rate limited using a token bucket 
mechanism.  The paper relies on a reinforcement learning approach to realize a simple policy that maximizes
classification accuracy under general image arrival patterns and arbitrary sequences of classification decisions.   

The code for the system described in the paper is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-dqn) and an extended version of the EMSOFT paper is accessible on arXiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00485)
