title: "Optimizing Edge Offloading Decisions for Object Detection."
collection: conferences
permalink: /conferences/2024-12-01-SEC
excerpt: 'The paper addresses the problem of object detection in an edge computing setting, where a (weak) detector is available on-board cameras capturing images of objects to facilitate distributed decisions, but is supplemented by a shared (stronger) edge detector accessible across a network and available when local decisions are uncertain. Constraints exist that limit how many images can be offloaded to the strong detector.  To assist in deciding which images to offload, the paper introduces a metric and a method for estimating it, which enable efficient online offloading decisions. The code for the system described in the paper is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/qiujiaming315/edgeml-object-detection) and a slightly extended version is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18919)'
