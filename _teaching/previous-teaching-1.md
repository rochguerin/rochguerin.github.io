**CSE 473S: Introduction to Computer Networks**

**Course Wiki**: <https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/cse473>

## Brief course description

This course provides a broad introduction to computer networking.  
It addresses all four major architectural layers of modern computer networks (application layer, transport layer, network layer and link layer),
as well as selected topics from wireless networking, network security and possibly others.    
**Application layer** topics include basic network programming and application layer protocols, including the protocols that underlie the world-wide web,
electronic mail, the domain name system and peer-to-peer applications.    
**Transport layer** topics include the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), principles of reliable data transfer and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP),
as well as peer-to-peer protocols.      
**Network layer** topics include key protocols from the Internet protocol suite (IPv4 and IPv6, as well as ICMP, DHCP and NAT),
plus router data and control plane functions. The latter covers general network routing algorithms and specific
Internet unicast and multicast routing protocols (OSPF, IS-IS, PIM and BGP).       
**Link layer** topics include multi-access protocols, Collision-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD),
Ethernet, link layer switching, and Virtual Local Area Networks (VLAN). Wireless topics include WiFi, cellular wireless networks and mobile IP.      
The topic of **network security** includes an introduction to basic cryptographic techniques, introduces security protocols,
and offers a review of major (network) attacks and associated defense.     
Prerequisites: CSE 247 (CSE 132 is helpful as well, though not mandatory). If you have any questions about prerequisites, please contact the instructor.
